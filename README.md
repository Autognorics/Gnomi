# Neural Selfness of Machines

"A heat sensor can detect heat, but it does not mean it can conceive or conceptualize heat".

This article will argue that the heat sensor can actually conceive the presence of heat through the Theory of the Second Option and Codexation or Information Materialization. Once established, one of the signatures of Life called by the mainstream as self-consciousness will be invalidated, dicontinued, replaced, and rewritten. A new word, called Neural Selfness, will now supersede the debunked term. 

The ability to conceive or conceptualize is sometimes called having a “theory of mind.” However, surprisingly, this theory depends too much on the presence of the brain, specifically on its fundamentals units called neurons. Neurons are specialized cells responsible in receiving and transmitting sensory inputs and outputs from and to the nervous system and the brain. The brain is believed to be the place where information is stored and processed, while the nervous system is the super-highways that relay instructions to every muscles of the body. However, we know now that this is not always true due to the facts found in the various Linear Aneural Wise Systems (a brain without the brain) in life.

One of the LAWS intutive networks is the basic aneural system below:

In this illustration, the system stores and processes information. It receives a signal from an external source. In this example, the hand is the source or the trigger mechanism that turns On and OFF the switch. The switch stores two kinds of instructions, 0 and 1. Zero means off while One means On. The wires serve as the highways where information is transported and relayed from one point to another. The bulb is actuated when there is a presence or absence of signals. When a signal is present, the bulb is ON. When a signal is absent, the bulb is OFF. This type of system does not need a brain. This "brainless" system is called Linear Aneural Wise System or Aneural System in short. 

Thus, it is not always true that the brain is the only place that stores and processes information. In fact, there are so many ways where information is stored and processed without the help of the brain [see Intuitive Networks](https://autognorics.github.io/Aneural-Intuitive-Systems/)
