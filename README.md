"A heat sensor can detect heat, but it does not mean it can conceive or conceptualize heat".

This article will redefine and rewrite one of the signatures of Life called by the mainstream as self-consciousness based on the contention above. 

The ability to conceive or conceptualize is sometimes called having a “theory of mind.” However, surprisingly, this theory depends too much on the fundamentals units of the brain called neurons. Neurons are specialized cells responsible in receiving and transmitting sensory inputs and outputs from and to the external surroundings.
