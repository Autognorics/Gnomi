### WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± This is not about Artificial Intelligence nor Machine Learning ...
- âš¡ The Fun fact: this is new school of thought that deals with creating engineered life forms, 
- ðŸ’¬ machines, things, and systems through Intuitive objects, Embedded Inscriptions, and
- ðŸ’¬ the Law of Symmetric Inversion or the Reverse Inverse Theory.

- Life evolves from being alive to being living. It is a process that is governed by six stages. 
- The sequence of life is based on the state of being of the individual. The Six Orders of Life:
-
- Alive = consumes energy without the need for neural reasoning.
- Aware = sends and receives signals using sensors without the need for neural reasoning.
- Conscious = matches things with things without the need for neural reasoning.
- Intutive = chooses this or that without the need for neural reasoning.
- Neural = self-knowledge 
- Living = experiences life (eafthos)
