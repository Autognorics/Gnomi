### WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± This is not about Artificial Intelligence nor Machine Learning ...
- âš¡ This is all about a new school of thought that deals with creating engineered life forms, 
- machines, things, and systems through Intuitive objects, Embedded Inscriptions, and
- the Law of Symmetric Inversion or the Reverse Inverse Theory.
- âš¡ The Revisionist Ideas:
- This is a paradigm shift that revises the notions about Life. 
- It uncovers that Life evolves from being alive to being living, a process governed by six stages. 
- The Six Orders of Life are:
- Aliveness = the ability to consume energy without the need for neural reasoning.
- Awareness = the ability to send and receive signals using IOs without the need for neural reasoning.
- Consciouness = the ability to match things with things without the need for neural reasoning.
- Intutiveness = the ability to choose between this or that without the need for neural reasoning.
- Neuralness = self-knowledge (a brain without the brain
- Living = experiences life (eafthos)
- âš¡ Another Fun fact:
