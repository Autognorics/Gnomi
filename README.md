### WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± This is neither about Artificial Intelligence nor Machine Learning ...
- âš¡ This is all about a new school of thought that deals with creating engineered life forms, 
- machines, things, and systems through Intuitive objects, Embedded Inscriptions, 
- the Reverse Inverse Theory, and Inscription by Design.
-
- âš¡ The Revisionist Ideas:
- A paradigm shift that redefines the essential elements that come along with the criteria of life. 
- Life evolves from being alive to being living, a process governed by six stages. 
- The Six Orders of Life:
- 1. Aliveness = the ability to consume energy without the need for neural reasoning.
- 2. Awareness = the ability to send and receive signals using IOs without the need for neural reasoning.
- 3. Consciouness = the ability to match things with things without the need for neural reasoning.
- 4. Intutiveness = the ability to choose between this or that without the need for neural reasoning.
- 5. Neuralness = self-knowledge (a brain without the brain)
- 6. Living = experiences life (eafthos)
-
- âš¡ Originemology:
-    eaftos = self
-    gnosei = knowledge
-    aftognosia = self-knowledge
-    zois = life-forms
-    autognozics = self-knowledge life-forms
-    Autognorics = the science of creating living machines
